# Pen and Sword

This sample demonstrates access to and usage of Logitech's MX Ink spatial stylus for Meta Quest. It allows for high-fidelity drawing and sketching in 3D, and replaces a controller.

In this sample, in addition to drawing in space, you can also switch your pen for a mighty sword by flicking the pen in your wrist. 

It demonstrates access to controller data and type, and how to react to those from within a user's Avatar representation.
