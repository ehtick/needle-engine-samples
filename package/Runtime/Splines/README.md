# Splines

Splines define a path in 3D space. You can use them to animate an object along a predefined path using an AnimationClip or dynamically controlled by user input.     

One common example is a camera that follows a spline curve and react to e.g. the user scroll input on a website. This is how [needle.tools](https://needle.tools) was built too!
