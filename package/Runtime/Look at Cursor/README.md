This cute website header / interactive embed was created with just built-in Needle Engine components. Move your mouse over the screen to see the 3D character look at it and the plants flying around him react to the movement.   

In this example we use the LookAt and FollowCursor components to make the character's head and eyes turn towards our mouse cursor.
