# [Material X](https://materialx.org/)

Material X is a widely supported shader system that allows for easy shader definition across various ecosystems.

It supports both node graphs for easy iteration and a code-driven approach, enabling you to construct shaders with an approachable high-level API directly in JavaScript/TypeScript.

You can download the Material X editor from [GitHub](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX).
