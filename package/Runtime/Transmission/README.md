# Transmission

Three.js has couple of essential materials already built-in. One of them is the [Mesh Physical Material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshPhysicalMaterial) that translates to the `UnityGLTF /PBR Graph` shader in Unity.

This sample showcases the Transmission effect, that takes the rendered frame of opaque objects and then uses it to bend the image to mimic refraction.
