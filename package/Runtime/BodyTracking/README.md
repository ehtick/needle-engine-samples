# VR Body Tracking

This WebXR feature estimates the whole body, allowing you as a developer to create much more immersive experiences by showing the user's body in your environment.

## Currently only available under a browser feature flag

In your Quest browser, navigate to `chrome://flags` and search for `WebXR experiments`. Set them from `default` to `enabled`. Restart your browser and a human skeleton should show up after you enter XR.
