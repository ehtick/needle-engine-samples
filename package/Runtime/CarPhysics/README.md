# Car Physics

## Features
- Physical Car Model for Needle Engine (three.js)
- Works with any model thanks for our automatic car detection:
- The CarPhysics component does automatically search for wheel objects and if none are found a default car rig is created
- Car Controller component to quickly get started with keyboard and gamepad support
- Car Radio component to stream music (e.g. from lastfm)
- Drag-Drop component to drop any model on your website to drive around
- Can be used with Unity to create filters, animations, materials...
